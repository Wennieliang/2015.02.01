 students utilize their free time to assist the local community. Some people hold that students are supposed to be unpaid in this period, while others believe that teenagers should be paid. I agree with the former, because in the process of serving the community helps students to learn the communicate skill with people and enables students to be endurable.

teenagers face problems when they serve the community. For example, when teenagers join the local community, they have a chance to instruct the pedestrian to follow the traffic lights,and after students doing it, they know how to talk in a courteous way to let people listen to their instructions. In short, assisting community can improve their problem-solving ability.

when teenagers assist the local community, they have extra duties. For instance, teenagers will be given job  clean streets in the community . they need to work for a long day and without resting or drink, which will  test their willpower and improve their endurance. To be brief, helping local community can increase their endurance.

To sum up, although teenagers will suffer a considerable of issues when helping the local community, it is  worth for them to assist the community as a volunteeer,which helps them to improve their problem-solving ability and  increase their endurance.
